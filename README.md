# kaltura-moodle_plugin-v3
Updated version from non KAF 3.1.02 (RL: 2.6.1.1) (2014010901) 

The v3 plugin for version 31 currently has a working filter, repository and video player/uploader. The video assignment is not working with no users enrolled in the course. I will aim to look into this at some point. Most features are untested and contain quick fixes.

The master version contains the fully working v3 plugin for Moodle 26.
